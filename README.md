README Requirements: Answer the following questions:
##What is the game about?
This game is called #MEALPREP Adventure at Trader Joe's. The player is challenged with a $30 budget as they choose items from certain categories. After a series of nine questions, if the player spends under $30, they won.

##What features did it include?
It has an intro page, a rules page and then 9 questions, followed by a result screen.
User can click in/out of different buttons within the question, but cannot go back.

##Were there any particular pain points or unsolved problems you had to manage? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)

###Pain Points:
-Regarding the functionality in JavaScript, I felt I had the right idea with some pieces of code, and Gainor helped me with the details (such as syntax and other things) to get it to work
-for each new question, I had issues with the button the person chose for any previous question to be lingering
-I had an issue with getting the player to be able to select only one button at a time. I found out that is solved by is input name = "" and that all the names for my buttons have to be the same.
-Styling became somewhat of a pain, but was achievable. I feel my project could be a better UI expereince. I'm not 100% in love with the design yet.

-Unsolved problems:
-I'm going to have a RESET button at the end of my quiz (I know it's location.reload();) but I need to add a couple things to get it to work
-I think the last page, where the result is displayed doesn't look very nice. Kind of looks boring, especially compared to the rest of the game.

##Is there any other information you think might help us understand what you've built?
###-This is a pretty simple game. It's similar to Buzzfeed quizzes where it asks you to select an item from each category and get a result.

##List the technologies used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, BitBallon (to deploy)

##Describe the approach taken
###I feel pretty good with time management. Typically when I'm working on something I feel that I seek help a lot sooner than I need to. For this project, since the day I started coding, Thursday, was a snow day, I was stuck with the choice of either giving up too soon or trying something out.

I was having a few errors with my code showing up on the browser. I decided to code everything I needed for my game to work to the best of my ability. So I did it to the closest to it being 100% right as I could get it. Then Friday I had Gainor help me fix errors and figure out what was missing.

The weekend I had a few issues and was about to go to the SRC Saturday and decided to try figuring these out on my own, and I got them to work.

I felt that overall in terms of what my project itself and the UX experience is, I think it could be better with better styling. I feel it could be better with slightly different styling changes and color choices.
